# Piki Dashboard

Simple dashboard api and react frontend for [Piki Os](https://github.com/twhiston/PikiOs)

Has 2 endpoints `/index.php` for the api and `/frontend/src/client/index.html` for the frontend
Obviously this will change ;)
Its autoconfigured if you use PikiOs with your pi so you dont need to worry about it

## API

App comes with a set of postman requests which you could use to test the api endpoint.
App is based on silex so should be easy to extend in future.

Still needs secure api endpoints before it can be used in production.
This will be sorted asap

## Frontend

A react application compiled by webpack, this is super simple at the moment.
If you want to contribute to this repo then this would be an ideal place


## TODO

- api root endpoint for ping status
